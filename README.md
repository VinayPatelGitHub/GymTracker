# GymTracker

## Project Overview
### Application Description
The application should assist gym users. By recording previous workout details (number of reps and number of sets, number of reps and amount of weight) the application can assist users in making workout decisions. Similarly, by clearly displaying patterns of exercise, regarding which muscle group is exercised and how often, the application can offer a benefit.

### Sprint 1
By the end of sprint one I aimed to have a three level applicaiton, with some interaction between the user interface and database using  buisness layer to preform a few basic crud operations.
#### Sprint Goals
- [x] complete user Story 0.1
- [ ] complete user Story 0.2
- [ ] complete user Story 0.3
- [x] complete Agile documentation
- [x] complete Agile review
- [x] complete Agile retrospective 
- [x] update "read me" file
- [x] commit all changes from local to git hub
#### Sprint Review
The database was completed, it took several modifications to ensure the necessary data could be stored effectively and easily assessed when needed.
Many feature methods were completed however uncertainty in connect a business layer to solution caused a reduction in productivity.
#### Sprint Retrospective
By finding examples to learn from I should be able to improve productivity. This will be especially effective in initially connecting the user interface and database to the business layer. Once a process is achieved replicating this for different functions should be less challenging. 

### Sprint 2
I aimed to have all the basic crude opperations working in the user interface. This was acheived. Looking ahead I need to test all functionality already created, I can then continue to improve funcionality and work on the layout, testing as i go.
#### Sprint Goals
- [x] complete user Story 0.2
- [x] complete user Story 0.3
- [ ] complete user Story 1.1
- [ ] complete user Story 1.1.1
- [ ] complete user Story 1.2
- [ ] complete user Story 1.2.1
- [ ] complete user Story 2.1
- [ ] complete user Story 2.1.1
- [x] complete Agile documentation
- [x] complete Agile review
- [x] complete Agile retrospective 
- [x] update "read me" file
- [x] commit all changes from local to git hub
#### Sprint Review
The user interface was created and I was able to complete all planned user stories. However I have gone back to adapt the user stories to include testing so the user stories will stay in the sprint backlog until the testing is complete.
The biggest blocker was finding a away to move data from the database to the user interface in an efficient way.
#### Sprint Retrospective
Using example I was able to work a lot faster. I will use this approach for the testing.
My working environment has cause me to become distracted at different points of the day. In the next sprint I plan to log time spent on different activities.
I also need to start estimate time to complete user stories so I can better estimate how much can be completed in a day. this is difficult to do with never processes such as testing, but once I get an idea I will start listing 'etas' in the sprint definition of done.
