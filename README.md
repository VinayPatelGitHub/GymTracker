# GymTracker

## Project Overview
Application Description
The application should assist gym users. By recording previous workout details (number of reps and number of sets, number of reps and amount of weight) the application can assist users in making workout decisions. Similarly, by clearly displaying patterns of exercise, regarding which muscle group is exercised and how often, the application can offer a benefit.

### Sprint 1
By the end of sprint one I aimed to have a three level applicaiton, with some interaction between the user interface and database using  buisness layer to preform a few basic crud operations.
#### Sprint Golas
- [x] complete user Story 0.1
- [ ] complete user Story 0.2
- [ ] complete user Story 0.3
- [x] complete Agile documentation
- [x] complete Agile review
- [x] complete Agile retrospective 
- [ ] update "read me" file
- [ ] commit all changes from local to git hub
#### Sprint Review
The database was completed, it took several modifications to ensure the necessary data could be stored effectively and easily assessed when needed.
Many feature methods were completed however uncertainty in connect a business layer to solution caused a reduction in productivity.
#### Sprint Retrospective
By finding examples to learn from I should be able to improve productivity. This will be especially effective in initially connecting the user interface and database to the business layer. Once a process is achieved replicating this for different functions should be less challenging.
